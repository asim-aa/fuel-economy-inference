# Fuel Economy & Statistical Testing Project

This project explores the relationship between car characteristics and fuel efficiency,
and compares statistical testing methods using simulation.

## Research Questions
1. Do cars with different drivelines (FWD, RWD, AWD) have different city MPG?
2. How does transmission type (manual vs automatic) interact with driveline in city MPG?
3. How do different implementations of the Kruskal–Wallis test behave with small samples?
4. Which method is more powerful: Welch one-way ANOVA or pairwise Welch t-tests with Holm correction?

## Methods
- ANOVA and linear models for city MPG
- Blocked permutation tests to avoid parametric assumptions
- Monte Carlo vs asymptotic Kruskal–Wallis simulations
- 10,000-replicate power analysis of Welch vs Holm procedures

## Key Results
- **FWD cars** are significantly more fuel-efficient in the city (~6 MPG more than RWD).
- **Manual transmissions** outperform automatics (~3 MPG advantage).
- **Permutation tests** validate ANOVA conclusions without relying on normality.
- **Simulation:** Asymptotic ≈ Monte Carlo for KW when n ≈ 10.
- **Power study:** Pairwise Welch + Holm consistently beats Welch F when only one group mean shifts.

## Repository Structure
- `R/`: Reproducible scripts for each problem.
- `run_all.R`: Runs the entire pipeline end-to-end.
- `outputs/`: Figures and tables generated by the scripts.
- `docs/`: Report and presentation slides.

## How to Run
```r
# clone repository
git clone https://github.com/YOURNAME/fuel-economy-inference.git
cd fuel-economy-inference

# run full pipeline
